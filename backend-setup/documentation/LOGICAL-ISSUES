QUESTION 


I HAVE A GENUINE DOUBT, IF A USER GET INTO THE MOVIE BOOKING AND HE RESERVED THE SEAT,
 AND THE MOMENT WE TURN ON INNGEST FOR AUTO DELETION FOR THAT BOOKINGID ,   
 AND USER REMAIN ON THE PAYMENT PAGE WITHOUT PAYING, THEN AFTER 10 MINUTE , 
 THE BOOKING ID DOCUMENT WILL BE DELETED AND SEAT WILL BE RELIVED BUT STILL 
 THE USER ON THE PAYMENT PAGE STRIPE . SO ON THE 11TH MINUTE , IF HE TRY TO MAKE
  THE PAYMENT THE PAYMENT WILL DONE BUT NO BOOKING ID OR DOCUMENT, WILL REMAIN . SO HOW TO SOLVE
   THIS ISSUE?  BY MAKING THE EXPIRY TIME OF STRIPE EXACTLY AS OF DELETING DOCUMENT? 10 MINUTE?
    CURRENCTLY STRIPE PAYMENT TIME IS 30 MINUTE FOR EXPIRY SO SHOULD I MAKE IT TO 10 MINUTE
     FOR STIPE ?

Excellent Question! This is a Real Problem! 🚨
You've identified a critical race condition:





1) Timeline: 
0:00  → User books seats
0:01  → Stripe checkout created (expires in 30 min)
0:01  → Inngest function scheduled (deletes in 10 min)
10:00 → Inngest deletes booking + releases seats ❌
11:00 → User pays on Stripe ✅
       → Payment succeeds but no booking exists! 💥



 ///issue again stripe needed 30 minute minimum epxiration timing 

 IF booking.status === "EXPIRED"
  → REFUND immediately
  → log late payment
ELSE
  → confirm booking
  → status = "CONFIRMED"



User stays on Stripe page
Booking expires at 10 min
User pays at 11 min

✅ What SHOULD happen

Payment succeeds (Stripe allows it)
Webhook fires
Backend sees:
booking.status === "EXPIRED"
You refund automatically
Show user:
“Payment received too late. Seats were released. Amount refunded.”




SOLUTIOHN 

Option 1: Make Stripe Expire at Same Time as Inngest (Recommended) ✅


MAKE THE STRIPE EXPIRY 10 MINUTE , SAME TIME MAKE INGEST EXPIRY 10 MINUTES
